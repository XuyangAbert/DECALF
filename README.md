## Getting Start
### Description: 
This project extends the ALCS algorithm to deep learning problems in image classification tasks. It utilized the architucture from DeepALplus toolkit and integrated the ALCS method into it.

## Example Usage

For the pytorch implementation, use the google colab with A100 GPU instance by running the `deepalplus_alcs.ipynb` file.

For users who prefer to use the tensorflow, the implementation of DeepALCS method for CIFAR-10, 100, and SVHN datasets can be found from the following files:

1. `DeepAL1.ipynb`
2. `DeepAL2.ipynb`
3. `DeepAL3.ipynb`

More ogranized code structure will be implement as the project goes on!
